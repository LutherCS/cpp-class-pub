# Hierarchy 

Complete the tasks as described in the header file and push your source code to GitHub. Each task must be a separate function.

If the brief description of a function is not descriptive enough check the parameters and the return value. Also, make sure to see the test file for the expected result.


Classes: Inheritance and Polymorphism
Complete the following tasks. Include your name and the assignment number in a comment on the top of the header file. Use the provided exercise10_out.txt as a guideline of the expected output of your program. Keep in mind that comment/uncomment section of the exercise10_main.cpp file as you complete the tasks. The file will not compile as provided. You must pass all tests provided.
