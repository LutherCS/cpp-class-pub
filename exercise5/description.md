# Structures 

Complete the tasks as described in the header file and push your source code to GitHub. Each task must be a separate function.

If the brief description of a function is not descriptive enough check the parameters and the return value.

Make sure the output or your program matches that in *build/exercise5_out.txt*.

Write *your own tests* for this exercise.

This exercise covers the following:

- Structures
- Tests
