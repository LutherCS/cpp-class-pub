# Templates 

Complete the tasks as described in the header file and push your source code to GitHub. Each task must be a separate function.

If the brief description of a function is not descriptive enough check the parameters and the return value. Also, make sure to see the test file for the expected result.

Modify exercise11.cpp to complete the following tasks. Include your name and the assignment number in a comment on the top of the header file. You must pass all tests provided.

## Tasks

1. Implement a function `fiboIte` that finds n-th number in the Fibonacci sequence (1, 1, 2, 3, 5, ...) using an iterative algorithm.
1. Implement a function `fiboRec` that finds n-th number in the Fibonacci sequence (1, 1, 2, 3, 5, ...) using an recursive algorithm.
1. Implement a function `factIte` that finds factorial of n using an iterative algorithm.
1. Implement a function `factRec` that finds factorial of n using a recursive algorithm.
1. Implement a function `convert` that converts any decimal number to any numbering system.
1. Implement a template function `add3` that takes 3 arguments of the same type and returns their sum (or the result of concatenation).
1. Implement a template function `addN` that takes variable number (at least 1) of arguments of the same type and returns their sum (or the result of concatenation).
1. Implement a template function `max3` that takes 3 arguments of the same type and returns the largest of them.
1. Implement a template function `maxN` that takes variable number of arguments of the same type and returns the largest of them.
1. Implement a template function `avgN` that takes variable number of arguments of the same type and returns their average.
   1. Implement a template function `countN` that takes variable number of arguments of the same type and returns their number.
