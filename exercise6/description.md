# Game Store 

Implement a game store that would operate across state borders. Read the store inventory and state sales tax rates from the provided files.

You need to display the inventory of the store and ask user about their choice of titles/quantity until the users no longer wants to add anything to the cart.

Once there are games in the cart, ask user for their location (state) and calculate the sales tax. Calculate the total amount due based on the price, quantity, and the sales tax.

Save the cart content to the file.

There are no unit tests for this exercise and the main file is mostly implemented. You need to complete the header and the implementation files.
